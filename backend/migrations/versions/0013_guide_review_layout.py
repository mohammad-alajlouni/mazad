"""Rebuild stored booklet page plans for version 8: the guide-review layout.

The selling-agent page follows the guide's column and carries its kashida
justified lines, the summary table fills its area with shared row heights,
rental rows are measured, and the additional-information box stores the size
its content is set at. Drafts recompose from their own data as in 0008-0012;
approved outputs stay exactly as approved.
